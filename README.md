# Let's Party

This repository contains the project I presented for my bachelor thesis. We designed and implemented a new social network that allows people to find clubs, bars and night-clubs in their area and to make reservations in such places. There is also a post section where people are able to read and interact with other users. All details are contained in my thesis.
